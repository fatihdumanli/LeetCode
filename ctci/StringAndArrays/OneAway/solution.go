//There are three types of edits can be performed o nstrings:
//- insert a character
//- remove a character
//- replace a character
//
//Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
//
//EXAMPLE
//--------
//
//pale, ple -> true
//pales, pale -> true
//pale, bale -> true
//pale, bake -> false
